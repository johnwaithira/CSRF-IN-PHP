# CSRF-IN-PHP ( Cross-Site Request Forgery )

- ``CSRF`` stands for cross-site request forgery. It’s a kind of attack in which a hacker forces you to execute an action against a website where you’re currently logged in.


For example, you visit the ``malicious-site.com`` that has a hidden form. And that form submits on page load to ``yourbank.com/transfer-fund form``.

Because you’re currently logged in to the ``yourbank.com``, the request silently transfers a fund out of your bank account.

If ``yourbank.com/transfer-fund`` implements the ``CSRF`` correctly, it generates a one-time token and inserts the token into the fund transfer form like this:

``` html
<input type="hidden" 
       name="token"        
       value="b3f44c1eb885409c222fdb51678dd3a33d3a18dd3">


```
When the ```malicious-site.com``` submits the form, the ``yourbank.com/transfer-fund form`` compares the token with the one on the *yourbank.com‘s* server.

If the token doesn’t exist in the submitted data or it doesn’t match with the token on the server, the fund transfer form will reject the submission and return an error.

When the ``malicious-site.com ``tries to submit the form, the token is likely not available or won’t match.

# How to implement CSRF token in PHP


- First, open a new folder in you local server and open it in you favourite IDE. In my case I;m using VS Code.
  
 ![project dir]( /files/open-new-folder.png "Create a new Project in local server folder")

 - ## Create a file and name it `login.php` 
 - ## Then, create a folder and name it `app` 
 - Inside that folder `app`, create 2 files 
    - CSRF.php
    - handleform.php


*Demo*

![Files and folder](/files/files_and_folder.png "Demo of the file and folder created")


# Create a CSRF Token 
- This is gonna be generated by a fuction that we will create inside `app/CSRF.php` file. 

#### `app/CSRF.php`

``` php

<?php
session_start();
class CSRF
{
    public static function create_token()
    {
        $token = md5(time());
        $_SESSION['token'] = $token;

        echo "<input name='token' value='$token' type= 'hidden'>";
    }


}

```

* # Explanation 

``` php
    session_start();
```
`session_start() ` function start a new session use the 


```php
 public static function create_token(){

        #code to be executed
 }

```
`create_token()` function returns the html form input filed

* $token is generated using `md5()` and the `time()` function 
```php
     $token = md5(time());
```

# In the `login.php `, add the following lines of code



```php


<?php 

require_once "./app/CSRF.php";
?>
<h2>Login Form With CSRF token</h2>
<form action="./app/handleform.php" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username">
    <br>
    <?php CSRF::create_token();?>
    <br>
    <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password">
    <br>
    <input type="submit" name="login" value="Login">
</form>


```


* # Explanation 

`require_once "./app/CSRF.php";` statement takes all the code that exists in the `CSRF.php` file and copies it into `login.php`

Since we have `CSRF.php` code, we can easily invoke the function `create_token()` by using

```php
    <?php CSRF::create_token();?>
```
which returns 

```html
<input name='token' value='8bd739595053867e1225aa8323effe73' type= 'hidden'>    

```


# Run the application int the browser and it should have the following output
